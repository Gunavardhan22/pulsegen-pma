      "text": "PEP 649 PEP 749 Â¶ The annotations on functions, classes, and modules are no\nlonger evaluated eagerly. Instead, annotations are stored in special-purpose annotate functions and evaluated only when\nnecessary (except if from __future__ import annotations is used). This change is designed to improve performance and usability of annotations\nin Python in most circumstances. The runtime cost for defining annotations is\nminimized, but it remains possible to introspect annotations at runtime.\nIt is no longer necessary to enclose annotations in strings if they\ncontain forward references. The new annotationlib module provides tools for inspecting deferred\nannotations. Annotations may be evaluated in the VALUE format (which evaluates annotations to runtime values, similar to the behavior in\nearlier Python versions), the FORWARDREF format\n(which replaces undefined names with special markers), and the STRING format (which returns annotations as strings). This example shows how these formats behave: >>> from annotationlib import get_annotations , Format >>> def func ( arg : Undefined ): ... pass >>> get_annotations ( func , format = Format . VALUE ) Traceback (most recent call last): ... NameError : name 'Undefined' is not defined >>> get_annotations ( func , format = Format . FORWARDREF ) {'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined', owner=<function func at 0x...>)} >>> get_annotations ( func , format = Format . STRING ) {'arg': 'Undefined'} The porting section contains guidance\non changes that may be needed due to these changes, though in the majority of\ncases, code will continue working as-is.

      "heading": "PEP 734: Multiple interpreters in the standard libraryÂ¶",
      "text": "PEP 734 Â¶ The CPython runtime supports running multiple copies of Python in the\nsame process simultaneously and has done so for over 20 years.\nEach of these separate copies is called an âinterpreterâ.\nHowever, the feature had been available only through\nthe C-API . That limitation is removed in Python 3.14,\nwith the new concurrent.interpreters module. There are at least two notable reasons why using multiple interpreters\nhas significant benefits: they support a new (to Python), human-friendly concurrency model true multi-core parallelism For some use cases, concurrency in software improves efficiency and\ncan simplify design, at a high level.\nAt the same time, implementing and maintaining all but the simplest concurrency\nis often a struggle for the human brain.\nThat especially applies to plain threads (for example, threading ),\nwhere all memory is shared between all threads. With multiple isolated interpreters, you can take advantage of a class\nof concurrency models, like Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)\nor the actor model, that have found\nsuccess in other programming languages, like Smalltalk, Erlang,\nHaskell, and Go. Think of multiple interpreters as threads\nbut with opt-in sharing. Regarding multi-core parallelism: as of Python 3.12, interpreters\nare now sufficiently isolated from one another to be used in parallel\n(see PEP 684 ). This unlocks a variety of CPU-intensive use cases\nfor Python that were limited by the GIL . Using multiple interpreters is similar in many ways to multiprocessing , in that they both provide isolated logical\nâprocessesâ that can run in parallel, with no sharing by default.\nHowever, when using multiple interpreters, an application will use\nfewer system resources and will operate more efficiently (since it\nstays within the same process). Think of multiple interpreters as\nhaving the isolation of processes with the efficiency of threads. While the feature has been around for decades, multiple interpreters\nhave not been used widely, due to low awareness and the lack of a\nstandard library module. Consequently, they currently have several\nnotable limitations, which are expected to improve significantly now\nthat the feature is going mainstream. Current limitations: starting each interpreter has not been optimized yet each interpreter uses more memory than necessary\n(work continues on extensive internal sharing between interpreters) there arenât many options yet for truly sharing objects or other\ndata between interpreters (other than memoryview ) many third-party extension modules on PyPI are not yet compatible\nwith multiple interpreters\n(all standard library extension modules are compatible) the approach to writing applications that use multiple isolated\ninterpreters is mostly unfamiliar to Python users, for now The impact of these limitations will depend on future CPython\nimprovements, how interpreters are used, and what the community solves\nthrough PyPI packages. Depending on the use case, the limitations may\nnot have much impact, so try it out! Furthermore, future CPython releases will reduce or eliminate overhead\nand provide utilities that are less appropriate on PyPI. In the\nmeantime, most of the limitations can also be addressed through\nextension modules, meaning PyPI packages can fill any gap for 3.14, and\neven back to 3.12 where interpreters were finally properly isolated and\nstopped sharing the GIL . Likewise, libraries on PyPI are expected\nto emerge for high-level abstractions on top of interpreters. Regarding extension modules, work is in progress to update some PyPI\nprojects, as well as tools like Cython, pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3.\nThe steps for isolating an extension module are found at Isolating Extension Modules .\nIsolating a module has a lot of overlap with what is required to support free-threading , so the ongoing\nwork in the community in that area will help accelerate support\nfor multiple interpreters.

      "heading": "PEP 750: Template string literalsÂ¶",
      "text": "PEP 750 Â¶ Template strings are a new mechanism for custom string processing.\nThey share the familiar syntax of f-strings but, unlike f-strings,\nreturn an object representing the static and interpolated parts of\nthe string, instead of a simple str . To write a t-string, use a 't' prefix instead of an 'f' : >>> variety = 'Stilton' >>> template = t 'Try some {variety} cheese!' >>> type ( template ) <class 'string.templatelib.Template'> Template objects provide access to the static\nand interpolated (in curly braces) parts of a string before they are combined.\nIterate over Template instances to access their parts in order: >>> list ( template ) ['Try some ', Interpolation('Stilton', 'variety', None, ''), ' cheese!'] Itâs easy to write (or call) code to process Template instances.\nFor example, hereâs a function that renders static parts lowercase and Interpolation instances uppercase: from string.templatelib import Interpolation def lower_upper ( template ): \"\"\"Render static parts lowercase and interpolations uppercase.\"\"\" parts = [] for part in template : if isinstance ( part , Interpolation ): parts . append ( str ( part . value ) . upper ()) else : parts . append ( part . lower ()) return '' . join ( parts ) name = 'Wenslydale' template = t 'Mister {name} ' assert lower_upper ( template ) == 'mister WENSLYDALE' Because Template instances distinguish between static strings and\ninterpolations at runtime, they can be useful for sanitising user input.\nWriting a html() function that escapes user input in HTML is an exercise\nleft to the reader!\nTemplate processing code can provide improved flexibility.\nFor instance, a more advanced html() function could accept\na dict of HTML attributes directly in the template: attributes = { 'src' : 'limburger.jpg' , 'alt' : 'lovely cheese' } template = t '<img {attributes} >' assert html ( template ) == '<img src=\"limburger.jpg\" alt=\"lovely cheese\" />' Of course, template processing code does not need to return a string-like result.\nAn even more advanced html() could return a custom type representing\na DOM-like structure. With t-strings in place, developers can write systems that sanitise SQL,\nmake safe shell operations, improve logging, tackle modern ideas in web\ndevelopment (HTML, CSS, and so on), and implement lightweight custom business DSLs.

      "text": "PEP 768 Â¶ Python 3.14 introduces a zero-overhead debugging interface that allows\ndebuggers and profilers to safely attach to running Python processes\nwithout stopping or restarting them.\nThis is a significant enhancement to Pythonâs debugging capabilities,\nmeaning that unsafe alternatives are no longer required. The new interface provides safe execution points for attaching debugger code\nwithout modifying the interpreterâs normal execution path\nor adding any overhead at runtime.\nDue to this, tools can now inspect and interact with Python applications\nin real-time, which is a crucial capability for high-availability systems\nand production environments. For convenience, this interface is implemented in the sys.remote_exec() function. For example: import sys from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile with NamedTemporaryFile ( mode = 'w' , suffix = '.py' , delete = False ) as f : script_path = f . name f . write ( f 'import my_debugger; my_debugger.connect( { os . getpid () } )' ) # Execute in process with PID 1234 print ( 'Behold! An offering:' ) sys . remote_exec ( 1234 , script_path ) This function allows sending Python code to be executed in a target process\nat the next safe execution point.\nHowever, tool authors can also implement the protocol directly as described\nin the PEP, which details the underlying mechanisms used to safely attach to\nrunning processes. The debugging interface has been carefully designed with security in mind\nand includes several mechanisms to control access: A PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG environment variable. A -X disable-remote-debug command-line option. A --without-remote-debug configure flag to completely disable\nthe feature at build time.

Preliminary benchmarks suggest a geometric\nmean of 3-5% faster on the standard pyperformance benchmark suite,\ndepending on platform and architecture.\nThe baseline is Python 3.14 built with Clang 19, without this new interpreter. This interpreter currently only works with Clang 19 and newer\non x86-64 and AArch64 architectures.\nHowever, a future release of GCC is expected to support this as well. This feature is opt-in for now. Enabling profile-guided optimization is highly\nrecommendeded when using the new interpreter as it is the only configuration\nthat has been tested and validated for improved performance.\nFor further information, see --with-tail-call-interp . Note This is not to be confused with tail call optimization of Python\nfunctions, which is currently not implemented in CPython. This new interpreter type is an internal implementation detail of the CPython\ninterpreter.  It doesnât change the visible behavior of Python programs at\nall.  It can improve their performance, but doesnât change anything else.

From Python 3.14, when compiling extension modules for the free-threaded build of\nCPython on Windows, the preprocessor variable Py_GIL_DISABLED now needs to\nbe specified by the build backend, as it will no longer be determined\nautomatically by the C compiler. For a running interpreter, the setting that\nwas used at compile time can be found using sysconfig.get_config_var() . The new -X context_aware_warnings flag controls if concurrent safe warnings control is enabled. The flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build\nand false for the GIL-enabled build. A new thread_inherit_context flag has been added,\nwhich if enabled means that threads created with threading.Thread start with a copy of the Context() of the caller of start() .  Most significantly, this makes the warning\nfiltering context established by catch_warnings be\nâinheritedâ by threads (or asyncio tasks) started within that context.  It also\naffects other modules that use context variables, such as the decimal context manager.\nThis flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for\nthe GIL-enabled build.

This unifies the behavior\nbetween the two syntaxes, but leads to some differences in behavior that\nmay affect users who introspect types at runtime: Both syntaxes for creating a union now produce the same string\nrepresentation in repr() .\nFor example, repr(Union[int, str]) is now \"int | str\" instead of \"typing.Union[int, str]\" . Unions created using the old syntax are no longer cached.\nPreviously, running Union[int, str] multiple times would return\nthe same object ( Union[int, str] is Union[int, str] would be True ),\nbut now it will return two different objects.\nUse == to compare unions for equality, not is .\nNew-style unions have never been cached this way.\nThis change could increase memory usage for some programs that use\na large number of unions created by subscripting typing.Union .\nHowever, several factors offset this cost:\nunions used in annotations are no longer evaluated by default in Python\n3.14 because of PEP 649 ; an instance of types.UnionType is\nitself much smaller than the object returned by Union[] was on prior\nPython versions; and removing the cache also saves some space.\nIt is therefore unlikely that this change will cause a significant increase\nin memory usage for most users. Previously, old-style unions were implemented using the private class typing._UnionGenericAlias .\nThis class is no longer needed for the implementation,\nbut it has been retained for backward compatibility,\nwith removal scheduled for Python 3.17.\nUsers should use documented introspection helpers like get_origin() and typing.get_args() instead of\nrelying on private implementation details. It is now possible to use typing.Union itself in isinstance() checks.\nFor example, isinstance(int | str, typing.Union) will return True ;\npreviously this raised TypeError . The __args__ attribute of typing.Union objects is\nno longer writable. It is no longer possible to set any attributes on Union objects.\nThis only ever worked for dunder attributes on previous versions, was never\ndocumented to work, and was subtly broken in many cases.

Think of multiple interpreters as threads\nbut with opt-in sharing.</p>\n<p>Regarding multi-core parallelism: as of Python 3.12, interpreters\nare now sufficiently isolated from one another to be used in parallel\n(see <span class=\"target\" id=\"index-21\"></span><a class=\"pep reference external\" href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/\"><strong>PEP 684</strong></a>). This unlocks a variety of CPU-intensive use cases\nfor Python that were limited by the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../glossary.html#term-GIL\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">GIL</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Using multiple interpreters is similar in many ways to\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing\" title=\"multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.\"><code class=\"xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">multiprocessing</span></code></a>, in that they both provide isolated logical\nâprocessesâ that can run in parallel, with no sharing by default.\nHowever, when using multiple interpreters, an application will use\nfewer system resources and will operate more efficiently (since it\nstays within the same process). Think of multiple interpreters as\nhaving the isolation of processes with the efficiency of threads.</p>\n<p>While the feature has been around for decades, multiple interpreters\nhave not been used widely, due to low awareness and the lack of a\nstandard library module. Consequently, they currently have several\nnotable limitations, which are expected to improve significantly now\nthat the feature is going mainstream.</p>\n<p>Current limitations:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>starting each interpreter has not been optimized yet</p></li>\n<li><p>each interpreter uses more memory than necessary\n(work continues on extensive internal sharing between interpreters)</p></li>\n<li><p>there arenât many options <em>yet</em> for truly sharing objects or other\ndata between interpreters (other than <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview\" title=\"memoryview\"><code class=\"xref py py-type docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">memoryview</span></code></a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>many third-party extension modules on PyPI are not yet compatible\nwith multiple interpreters\n(all standard library extension modules <em>are</em> compatible)</p></li>\n<li><p>the approach to writing applications that use multiple isolated\ninterpreters is mostly unfamiliar to Python users, for now</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The impact of these limitations will depend on future CPython\nimprovements, how interpreters are used, and what the community solves\nthrough PyPI packages. Depending on the use case, the limitations may\nnot have much impact, so try it out!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, future CPython releases will reduce or eliminate overhead\nand provide utilities that are less appropriate on PyPI. In the\nmeantime, most of the limitations can also be addressed through\nextension modules, meaning PyPI packages can fill any gap for 3.14, and\neven back to 3.12 where interpreters were finally properly isolated and\nstopped sharing the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../glossary.html#term-GIL\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">GIL</span></a>. Likewise, libraries on PyPI are expected\nto emerge for high-level abstractions on top of interpreters.</p>\n<p>Regarding extension modules, work is in progress to update some PyPI\nprojects, as well as tools like Cython, pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3.\nThe steps for isolating an extension module are found at\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../howto/isolating-extensions.html#isolating-extensions-howto\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Isolating Extension Modules</span></a>.\nIsolating a module has a lot of overlap with what is required to support\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#whatsnew314-free-threaded-cpython\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">free-threading</span></a>, so the ongoing\nwork in the community in that area will help accelerate support\nfor multiple interpreters.</p>\n<p>Also added in 3.14: <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#whatsnew314-concurrent-futures-interp-pool\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor</span></a>.</p>\n<p>(Contributed by Eric Snow in <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/134939\">gh-134939</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"admonition seealso\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">See also</p>\n<p><span class=\"target\" id=\"index-22\"></span><a class=\"pep reference external\" href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/\"><strong>PEP 734</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"pep-750-template-string-literals\">\n<span id=\"whatsnew314-template-string-literals\"></span><h3><span class=\"target\" id=\"index-23\"></span><a class=\"pep reference external\" href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/\"><strong>PEP 750</strong></a>: Template string literals<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#pep-750-template-string-literals\" title=\"Link to this heading\">Â¶</a></h3>\n<p>Template strings are a new mechanism for custom string processing.\nThey share the familiar syntax of f-strings but, unlike f-strings,\nreturn an object representing the static and interpolated parts of\nthe string, instead of a simple <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../library/stdtypes.html#str\" title=\"str\"><code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">str</span></code></a>.</p>\n<p>To write a t-string, use a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">'t'</span></code> prefix instead of an <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">'f'</span></code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-pycon notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt;

stacks, and which tasks are awaiting them.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">pstree</span></code> subcommand fetches the same information, but instead renders a\nvisual async call tree, showing coroutine relationships in a hierarchical format.\nThis command is particularly useful for debugging long-running or stuck\nasynchronous programs.\nIt can help developers quickly identify where a program is blocked,\nwhat tasks are pending, and how coroutines are chained together.</p>\n<p>For example given this code:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-python
